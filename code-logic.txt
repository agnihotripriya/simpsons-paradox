1. Start with N cells, of which a proportion (=fraction) p are mutant. Let
N be large (~100,000) and p be small (~.00001), so that N.p~1.

2. Pick a small sample of size n from N. "Small" means that the number you
pick, namely n,  has a Poisson distribution with mean L where L<1, or at
most L~1.

3. Repeat procedure two s times, so that you end up with s samples in all.
Let s be a large number - if possible, 1000. Each sample can be imagined
to be a group of spores that gives rise to a group of amoebae and,
eventually, to a fruiting body.

4. In each of the s samples, see how many cells are mutant, say (f.n), and
how many are wild type, which will be therefore {1-f).n}.

5. Assign a fitness of 1 to each mutant cell and w to each wild-type cell,
with 0<w<1.

6. Count the number of wild-type and mutant cells in each of the s groups.
Round off fractions so that any fractional cell (i.e. <0.5) is ignored
(i.e. taken as=0).

7. Pool all the s groups together and count the overall proportions of
wild type and mutant cells.

8. Scale up the number of cells to N. Make sure that relative proportions
do not change.

9. Go back to step 1. N will be as before, but p will have changed; call
the new value p'.

10. Repeat the procedure from step 1 to step 9 a very large number of
times. Each repetition is equivalent to one generation - or better, one
life cycle.

11. How does p behave as a function of the number of generations?

12. Repeat steps 1 to 11 many times.

13. Repeat 1 to 12 with different parameter values (N, L, p, s)
